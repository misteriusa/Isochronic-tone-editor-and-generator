# Best Practices for Isochronic Tone Creation and Use

Isochronic tones employ evenly spaced pulses of sound to encourage brainwave entrainment. Responsible use is essential to maximize potential benefits and reduce risks.

## Safe Usage Guidelines

- **Consult professionals** – Isochronic tones are not a medical treatment. Seek advice from a qualified healthcare provider before use, especially if you have neurological or psychiatric conditions.
- **Moderate volume** – Keep playback levels below 85 dB to prevent hearing damage and allow comfortable listening.
- **Session length** – Beginners should limit sessions to 10–20 minutes and monitor for fatigue or discomfort.
- **Environment** – Use in a quiet, seated setting. Do not listen while driving or operating machinery.

## Editing Recommendations

- **Frequency range** – Brainwave entrainment effects typically occur between 0.5 Hz and 40 Hz; stay within this range unless supported by evidence.
- **Gradual transitions** – Apply fade‑in/out envelopes and avoid abrupt frequency jumps to maintain listener comfort.
- **Documentation** – Clearly label presets with intended purpose, session duration, and any contraindications.

## Scientific Background

Research on auditory entrainment suggests that rhythmic stimulation can influence cognitive states, though results vary by individual and protocol. Randomized studies report changes in attention, mood, and relaxation when using isochronic or related stimuli【1†L1-L2】【2†L1-L3】.
