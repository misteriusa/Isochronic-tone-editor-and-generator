# ADR-0001: Adopt FastAPI + Next.js Stack

## Context

The team needs a full-stack reference implementation for an isochronic tone studio that supports rapid iteration, typed APIs, and modern frontend workflows. Requirements include offline-friendly setup, Dockerized deployment, and strong tooling defaults.

## Decision

Adopt a FastAPI + SQLModel backend with Alembic migrations for typed database access, paired with a Next.js App Router frontend styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui primitives. Dev tooling includes Ruff, mypy, Vitest, and GitHub Actions CI.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Unified typing across backend and frontend, scaffolded auth example, container-native deployment.
- **Negative:** Dual package managers (Poetry + npm) increase onboarding complexity.
- **Mitigations:** Provide `scripts/bootstrap.sh` and documentation plus CI automation to guard regressions.
