    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository's code.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up the Java Development Kit (JDK).
      # This uses Java version 17 from the 'temurin' distribution.
      # It also caches Gradle dependencies to speed up future builds.

        uses: actions/setup-java@v3

          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: gradle

      # Step 3: Grant execute permission to the Gradle wrapper script.
      # This is necessary to ensure the script can be run on the Linux runner.
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x gradlew

      # Step 4: Build the project using the Gradle wrapper.
      # The 'build' task compiles the code, runs tests, and assembles the application.
      # The GRADLE_OPTS environment variable is used to disable the Gradle daemon,
      # which is recommended for CI environments.

        run: ./gradlew build

          GRADLE_OPTS: -Dorg.gradle.daemon=false
